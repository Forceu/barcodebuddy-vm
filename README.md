## Donations

As with all Free software, the power is less in the finances and more in the collective efforts. I really appreciate every pull request and bug report offered up by BarcodeBuddy's users, so please keep that stuff coming. If however, you're not one for coding/design/documentation, and would like to contribute financially, you can do so with the link below. Every help is very much appreciated!
